# animal-localization

The dataset that I used for this project is taken from kaggle.
LINK: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10

My purpose for this project was to create and train a model that can take pictures of 
animals on random backgrounds, and then localize and classify them.

Majority of the project was done in Google Colab.

some of the files that I have attached to this repository ended up not being useful 
to the project or just ideas that I started and ended up aborting halfway through.
